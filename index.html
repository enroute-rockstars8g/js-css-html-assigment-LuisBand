            <p>
                Whell, i'm Luis, i'm 22 years old. I was born in April 26 fom 1999 in a little town from morelos state called Tlayacapan, near CDMX.
                Maybe you have heard about Tepoztlan, just maybe. Well, Tlayacapan is kind of like Tepoztlan but without a pyramid lol, but that's
                another story. <br> <br> 
                
                When i was at kinder garden i liked a lod dancing or participate in any event, also i was in the kinder's band where i played the 
                cymbals. During this time, in my childhood, my parents worked a lot and i was the only person living at my house, so it was normal
                that frecuently i had accidens, brake things or also get lost because i liked to fall asleep everywhere so it somtimes was a problem
                for my parents to find where i was sleeping lol.<br><br>

                Then, when i was like 12 years old (i don't know exactly how old i was) i entered at elementary school. There is not much to tell 
                about this time, it was almost the same thing. Just fot the fact that i got into a symponic band where i learned to play trombone, 
                and also i got into the school band again. I think those are the only remarkable things about that time. <br><br>

                High School was the most remarkable time for me. I stared to hang out with friends, attend to a partys an that kind of things, also 
                i needed to start to decide about my carrer, and it wasn't easy for me but i'm happy with my decision. Before High school i was really
                really shy, but i think high school and my friendships changed me a lot. <br> <br>

                I studied Engineering in Information Technologies at the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP), where i started to learn 
                programming. I remember i was so excited in my first semester, i really liked programming. Then my friends and i started to participate 
                in Hackathons and those where really fun. I got graduated in the last year 2021. And now i'm looking forward to become an enrouter!

            <h2 class="subtittle">Why IT.</h2>
            <p>
                When i was at High School i got into social sciences because was looking to become a lawyer lol, but then i realized thad i didn't 
                really liked it. Also i noticed that i was doing beter at subjects that had more to do with practice than with theory, so in my list 
                of possible carrers where Architecture and IT but i've allways liked technology stuff, videogames and all those things so i decided 
                to apply for IT, and i'm not dissapointed, i think i did the best choice.
